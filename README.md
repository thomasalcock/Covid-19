# Covid-19
Some explorations of the Covid-19 Data taken from the European Center for Disease Control. 
To download the data into R, use the `get_source_data()` function, found in the `covid_functions.R` script.

To install all dependencies, you can first install the `renv` package and then restore the necessary packages using `renv::restore(confirm = FALSE)`.
